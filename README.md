# Rule Engine with AST

## Description
This project is a 3-tier rule engine that uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to dynamically create and evaluate rules.

## Setup
1.create project folder
2.create various folders
3.initialize git repository
4.create required files
5.setup virtual enviroment
6.install dependencies(unittest)
7.implementing the code --> ast data structure
                        --> writing tests cases
8.running the application --> activate the virtual enviroment
                          --> run the application
                          -->  run tests
{all codes provided} 

# How the project works?
1. main.py: demonstrates the rule engine's functionaliblity by creating and evaluating.
2. tests/test_engine.py: validates the correctness of the code using test cases.
3. data/rules.json: (samples) stores predefined rules for reference.
4. README.md: documentation with setup, usage, and tests instructions
